Description:
    This module contains the QuizGame class and related functions that handle
    the core quiz logic, including question selection, answer processing,
    scoring, and result analysis. It serves as the central coordinator between
    the UI, timer, and question database modules.

Classes:
    QuizGame: Main quiz game class that manages quiz flow and scoring
        - Handles question preparation and randomization
        - Processes user answers and maintains score
        - Tracks wrong topics for study recommendations
        - Coordinates with UI and timer modules

Functions:
    create_quiz(): Factory function to create and run a quiz instance

Features:
    - Intelligent question selection based on difficulty
    - Random question and option shuffling for variety
    - Answer validation and timeout handling
    - Topic-based performance tracking
    - Integration with timed and untimed input modes
    - Comprehensive result reporting

Dependencies:
    - random: For question and option shuffling
    - time: For timing delays and user experience
    - ..data.question_loader: Question database and filtering functions
    - ..ui.terminal_ui: Display functions and color constants
    - .timer: Timed input functionality

Usage:
    from mushroom_quiz.core import create_quiz
    score, total = create_quiz("intermediate", 10, 30)
