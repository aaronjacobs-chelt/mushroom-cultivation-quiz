# üçÑ Mushroom Cultivation Quiz Application

A comprehensive, modular quiz application that tests knowledge about mushroom cultivation techniques, varieties, substrates, and terminology.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The application is organized into separate modules for better maintainability:

```
mushroom_quiz_app.py     # Main application entry point
quiz_ui.py              # User interface and display functions
quiz_questions.py       # Question database and utilities
quiz_logic.py           # Core quiz game logic and flow
quiz_timer.py           # Timed input functionality
README_quiz.md          # This documentation file
```
